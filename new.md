A flowchart titled "Factor or Principal Components Analysis" illustrating the process from raw data to final factors.

**Raw Data: m Q-SORTS OF n STATEMENTS**
- A vertical line labeled with nodes 1 and 2.
- Left label: "RAW DATA: m Q-SORTS OF n STATEMENTS".
- The left side shows a diagram of raw data:
  - Top row (n = 4): Grey cells indicate distinct statements, while white cells represent Q-sorts.
  - Middle row (m = 8) shows an unrotated correlation matrix where grey cells mark unique statements.
  - Bottom row (m = 6) shows another unrotated correlation matrix with some statements flagged in black.

**Analytical Steps (Left Path, A → D)**
- Node 1 (top): Initial data matrix.
- Node 2 (middle): Correlation matrix.
- Node 3 (lower-left): Unrotated factors.
- Node 4 (lower-middle): Rotated factor loadings.
- Node 5 (bottom-right): f factors.

**Final Factors (Right Path, G → F)**
- Node 5 (upper-right): Final f factors.
- Node 6 (right-center): Z-scores and factor scores.
- Node 7 (right-bottom): Factor weights.
- Node 8 (far right): Distinguishing statements.
- Node 9 (very far right): Flagging observations: yes or no, and flagging criteria.

**Additional Q Analysis (Between A and B/C/D/E/F/G)**
- Dashed box labeled "FACTOR OR PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS".
  - Inside, arrows point to boxes containing diagrams for:
    - f1, f2, f3 (gray squares).
    - f (black square in a grid).

The flow chart visually represents how initial Q-sort data is transformed through various statistical analyses into final factors representing distinguishing statements.
